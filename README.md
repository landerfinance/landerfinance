### Hi there, it's [Lander finance](https://lander.finance/) 👋

Lander is implemented as a set of smart contracts. These smart contracts enable non-custodial, permissionless markets for decentralized lending. Inspired by such groundbreaking projects as Aave, Compound, Impermax, and Uniswap, Lander enables an entirely new DeFi experience.

The core and periphery contracts for lending pools are deployed on the BSC network. These contracts are permissionless,  and designed to operate with minimal governance.

The core contracts of the Lander Protocol consist of the Factory and Deployers for each lending pool. All lending pools are isolated. If a borrower ends up getting liquidated in one lending pool, other lending pools are not affected.

The periphery contracts of the Lander Protocol are designed to allow users to interact with the core contracts. These periphery contracts enable specific functions such as depositing LP tokens, supplying individual tokens to a lending pool, and creating a leveraged position.

Lander offer an algorithmic and autonomous interest rate protocol that delivers superior flexibility and, ultimately, enhanced yields for our users.
